# Modules
Modules are how code is organized in Halcyon: all variables, functions, and types must be inside a module.
There are a number of built-in modules supported by Halcyon. These are implicitly in scope in all Halcyon programs.
- [std](./docs/modules/std.md)
- [list](./docs/modules/list.md)
- [opt](./docs/modules/opt.md)
- [result](./docs/modules/result.md)
- [string](./docs/modules/string.md)

The following modules are planned, but remain unimplmented 
- [btree](./docs/modules/btree.md)
